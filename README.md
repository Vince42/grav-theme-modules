# Modules Theme
The **Modules** Theme is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).  This README.md file should be modified to describe the features, installation, configuration, and general usage of this theme.

## Description
The theme is based on Quark.

## Feature requests
I will describe the rough ideas, of what the theme should be able to do in the future.

### Page module
The page module displays bricks for every page of a specified subset of pages. The visual appearance is like the one on the blog page. The subset is specified by collecting the pages of a certain folder and to filter those by a specified taxonomy. The amount of page summaries should be customizable.
The ultimate functionality would allow to gather pages from several folders and to filter them by different criteria connected with AND and OR.

### Picture module
The picture module should work like a gallery or a slideshow. The user should be able to select media and to specify, whether all media is displayed at once (customizable limiitation as in the page module) or a certain amount of media slots are displayed and all media are scrolled.

### Feature module 2
The "feature module 2" should work like the feature module, but with uploadable graphics

### Graphics administration
The following graphics should be specifyable through the admin interface:
- Site logo
- Favourite icon

### Default colours
It would be nice to brand a site with a primary and secondary colour. Those colours should be specifyable through the admin interface.

### Font
It would be nice, if the user could upload his own font for the site.

### Other module ideas
- Google Maps
- Twitter feed
- Google Docs
- YouTube
- &hellip
